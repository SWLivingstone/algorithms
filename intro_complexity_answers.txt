1. An algorithm of complexity O(1) is a jet plane
and an algorith of complexity O(2^n) is a hot air balloon.

2. The best case performance for Binary Search is
constant time.  That would be if the first index
examend containted the searched for item.

3. The worst case performance for Binary Search is
logarithmic.  That would be if the final index searched
contained the searched for item.

4. The bounded case is logarithmic.

5. See graph 1

  6. Infinity

  7. 0(log n)

8 & 9:

As we discussed I will be skipping these questions.

10. O(log n)
11. OMEGA(1)
12. THETA(log n)
